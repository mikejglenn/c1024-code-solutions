## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  Variables act as containers for storing data values.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  Variables can be declared using the var, let, and const keywords.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  Declare a variable and use the = assignment operator to assign it a value. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  Characters in variable names can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but must start with a letter, $, or \_

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that capitalization matters. Two variables with the same name, but with different capitalization, are treated as 2 separate variables.

- What is the purpose of a string?
  A string in TypeScript is a sequence of characters used to represent text.

- What is the purpose of a number?
  Numbers in TypeScript are used to represent both integer and floating-point values. Numbers can be used in TypeScript for mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  Booleans in TypeScript represent one of two values: true or false. They are typically used in conditional testing where you need to decide which path of code to execute based on the truthiness of a condition.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  The = symbol is used as the assignment operator in TypeScript. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
  Use the = assignment operator to give the variable an updated value.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  The value null is intentionally used to represent "no value" or "empty value". It must be assigned explicitly to a variable. The value undefined is assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized with a value. It represents the absence of value or "not defined". The type of undefined is undefined, while null is an object. undefined typically indicates that a variable has not been initialized, while null is used to intentionally denote the absence of any value.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  Including labels when logging values to the console provides context to what is being logged.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  string, number, boolean, undefined, null
