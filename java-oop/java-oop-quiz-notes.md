## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a class?
  `In Java, a class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data (attributes or fields) and behavior (methods) that objects of that class will possess. Think of it as a template that specifies the structure and functionality of objects.`

- How does a class differ from an object?
  `In Java, a class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, defining their common properties and behaviors. An object, on the other hand, is a concrete instance of a class, representing a specific entity with its own unique state.`

- What is an interface? How does it differ from a class?
  `In Java, an "interface" is a collection of method signatures (defining what a method does, but not how it's implemented) that a class must implement, essentially acting as a contract that specifies the behaviors a class must adhere to, while a "class" is a blueprint for creating objects, containing both data (variables) and methods with concrete implementations of behavior; the key difference is that an interface only defines the "what" of a behavior, not the "how" like a class does.`

- Briefly explain inheritance, superclass, and subclass.
  `In Java, inheritance is a mechanism where a new class acquires properties and behaviors of an existing class. The existing class is called the superclass (or parent class), and the new class is called the subclass (or child class).`

- What access modifiers does Java support and how do they apply?
  `Java supports four access modifiers: public, protected, private, and the "default" access modifier (also called "package-private") which is applied when no explicit modifier is used; these control the visibility of class members (fields and methods) and determine which classes can access them from different packages and inheritance hierarchies:. `
