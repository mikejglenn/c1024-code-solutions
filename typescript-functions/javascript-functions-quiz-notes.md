## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  In JavaScript, a function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. It is a reusable piece of code that can be called multiple times from different parts of your program.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function keyword to begin the creation of a new function. An optional name of the function. A comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by () parentheses. The start of the function's code block, as indicated by an { opening curly brace. An optional return statement. The end of the function's code block, as indicated by a } closing curly brace.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The function's name. A comma-separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by () parentheses.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The definition contains the code of the function. The call simply runs the function.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are placeholder variables whose values aren't known until the function is called and an argument is passed. When the function's code block is run, the parameter will be holding the value of the argument. Arguments are the data passed to the function call itself.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters are useful in function declarations to give functions the ability to receive input and perform actions based on that input.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
  Prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  The function keyword is not used and an arrow [=>] is used between the parameter list and code block.

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  An implicit return when curly braces {} are not used to contain the function's code block.
