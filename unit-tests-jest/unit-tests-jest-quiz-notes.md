## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are unit tests?
  `Unit tests are a type of software testing that involves testing isolated pieces of code to ensure they behave as expected. `

- Why is it important to write unit tests?
  `Key benefits of unit testing are early bug detection, improved code quality, easier debugging, confidence in refactoring, automation potential, and documentation value.`

- What code should be tested with a unit test? What code is not well suited for unit tests?
  `A unit test should focus on testing small, isolated units of code like individual functions primarily targeting their core logic and functionality. This includes input validation, calculations, and output generation. Also edge cases should be tested. Code that is not well suited for unit tests is typically highly coupled to external dependencies, has significant side effects, relies heavily on randomness, interacts with external systems directly (like databases or network calls), or performs complex calculations with numerous variables that are difficult to isolate and test individually.`

- What is Jest? What are some other popular JavaScript unit testing frameworks?
  `Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure the correctness of any JavaScript codebase. Other JavaScript testing frameworks include Mocha, Storybook, and Playwright.`
