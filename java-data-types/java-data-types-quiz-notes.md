## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What two kinds of data types does Java support?
  `Primitive Types. Reference Types`

  - How do they differ?
  `Reference types are passed by reference to methods; in other words, the "pointer to" the memory location is passed. This is important because it means that a method can modify the referenced value that is passed and that change will be reflected in the caller's reference. With primitive types, this is not possible.`

- What primitive data types does Java support?
  `char (UTF-16 code units, '\u0000' to '\uffff')
boolean (true or false)
byte (8 bits, -128 to 127)
int (32 bits, -2147483648 to 2147483647)
short (16 bits, -32768 to 32767)
long (64 bits, -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807)
float (32 bits)
double (64 bits)`

- What is the syntax for declaring variables in Java?
`In Java, variables are declared by giving the variable's type, followed by the variable name.`
