## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the Java naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes?
  `Variable names by convention use lowerCamelCase, and never use $ or _. Also, it is common to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constant names, though this convention is waning in popularity. It is frowned upon to use prefixes or suffixes to indicate fields (such as mCount) or data type (such as nameStr), though these conventions were in broad use many years ago, so you may encounter them. Good naming style suggests that variable names typically are nouns or state (e.g., count or isOpen). Method names by convention also use lowerCamelCase following the same conventions as variables. Good naming style suggests that method names typically are verbs or verb phrases (e.g., getCount() or readData()). Note that it is legal for two methods of a class or interface to have the same name, as long as their call signatures differ. This is called method overloading. Class and interface names by convention use UpperCamelCase. Good naming style suggests that class names typically are nouns(e.g., Car).`

- What data type can the expression in an `if` or `while` have?
  `boolean`

- What data type can the expression in a `switch` have? And the `case` values?
  `For switch must be integral values, strings, and enums. For case must be constants. `

- What is a convenient `for` construct for looping through an array?
  `for-each like for (int item : numbers) where numbers is an array`
