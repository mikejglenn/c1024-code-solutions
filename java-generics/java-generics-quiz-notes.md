Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of generics?
`The purpose of generics in Java is to enable the creation of classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on types as parameters.`

- What is a type parameter?
`In Java, a type parameter is a placeholder for a specific type that is unknown at the time a generic class, interface, or method is defined. It is a fundamental component of Java Generics, which enables the creation of reusable components that can operate on different data types while maintaining type safety.`

- What is a type argument?
`In Java, a type argument is the specific, concrete data type provided when instantiating a generic class, interface, or invoking a generic method. It replaces the type parameter defined in the generic declaration.`

- How do you specify type parameters and arguments in Java?
