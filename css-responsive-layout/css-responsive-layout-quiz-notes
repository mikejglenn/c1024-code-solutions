## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  `A breakpoint defines a screen size where the design should adjust to a different layout.`

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  `Using percentages instead of fixed sizes in CSS offers several advantages, such as making a website more responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.`

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  `When specificity is equal the rule will go by source order.`
