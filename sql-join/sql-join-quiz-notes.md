## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a foreign key?
  `A "foreign key" in a database is a column (or set of columns) in one table that references the primary key of another table, essentially creating a link between the two tables and ensuring data consistency by enforcing that related data exists in both tables.`

- How do you join two SQL tables? (Provide at least two syntaxes.)
  `join clause or have where of one column id equal to the column id of another table`

- How do you temporarily rename columns or tables in a SQL statement?
  `as clause`

- How do you create a one-to-many relationship between two tables?
  `a foreign key in one table pointing to a primary key in another table, creates a one-to-many relationship between the two tables.`

- How do you create a many-to-many relationship between two tables?
  `Many-to-many relationships can be modeled by introducing a 3rd table that contains a foreign key to one of the tables and another foreign key to the other table.`
